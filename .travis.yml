  # The https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants-for-travis-osx-ci repo this CI runs for is force
  # pushed to asynchronously by https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants CI jobs.  With multiple
  # shards in play for the OSX ci we often get into situations where later-scheduled shards
  # try to check out the repo and fail since the sha they are looking for has since been
  # eradicated by a force push from the https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants CI job when changes
  # are landing on master quickly.  We fail-fast here to not belabor the point and allow the next
  # green OSX CI to happen more quickly.
